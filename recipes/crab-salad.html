    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is how we would make crab salad at the restaurant I worked at in Hawaii 
            and it was always a favorite! I love making this crab salad as a quick snack 
            or an easy lunch. You can either have it plain, as a crab dip, as crab macaroni
             salad, as a crab salad sandwich, or any of the other possibilities below. 
             I have had it all the different ways and I honestly canâ€™t pick a favorite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Imitation crab meat (or real crab meat)</li>
            <li>Celery</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Fresh dill (optional)</li>
            <li>Optional ingredients: onions, dill, chopped cucumber, cumin, dijon mustard 
                (see more variation ideas below)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Break imitation crab meat into small pieces with hands, or coarsely chop 
                with a knife. You can also coarsely chop in a blender or food processor.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the celery. This gives the crab salad a little crunch, but 
                not too much. Toss crab, celery, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir in mayonnaise and lemon until crab is evenly coated.</li>
        </ol>
