    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Crème brûlée is a decadent French dessert consisting of a custard base and a
         caramelized sugar crust. The treat is traditionally served in individual ramekins. 
         You can use a butane torch to achieve the perfect caramelization if you'd like, 
         but this crème brûlée recipe is easily finished under your oven's broiler.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Egg yolks: This classic crème brûlée recipe starts with egg yolks, ensuring 
            a rich dessert.</li>
            <li>White sugar: You'll need six tablespoons of white sugar — four for the 
            custard and two for the caramelized topping.</li>
            <li> Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract adds complexity and enhances the overall 
            flavor of this crème brûlée.</li>
            <li>Cream: Heavy whipping cream is whisked into the egg yolks over low heat until
             nice and thick.</li>
            <li>Brown sugar: A blend of white and brown sugars is sprinkled over the custard 
            and broiled until perfectly caramelized.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the custard: Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla in a bowl. Heat the 
                cream until it's almost boiling, then whisk the cream into the egg mixture. 
                Pour the mixture into a double boiler and stir over simmering water until thick.</li>
            <li>Bake and chill the custard: Pour the mixture into crème brûlée dishes or ramekins.
                 Bake in a preheated oven until set. Cool to room temperature, then chill 
                 in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Caramelize the sugar: Sprinkle each custard with a blend of brown and 
                white sugars. Place under your oven's broiler until the sugar is melted 
                and caramelized. Chill before serving.</li>
        </ol>
